Feature requests on our GitHub page should be for changes to the SDK that are within the project's current scope. We recommend voicing support for larger changes on the Azure feedback forum.

Tips to submit an enhancement that may be approved: 
 - The idea should fit with the purpose of the Azure Kinect Sensor SDK, which is to control and access Azure Kinect devices.
 - Well thought out ideas considering edge cases and API design will be more likely for someone to pursue.
 - We avoid breaking changes. If your feature results in a breaking change it won't be considered until a future major release. 
 - Link to an existing feedback item on https://aka.ms/azurekinectfeedback to show community support for your feature.
