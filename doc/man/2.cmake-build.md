The CMakeLists.txt offers a 4 build of options

```cpp
# build options
option(EXECUTE_TARGET "Execute Project Target" ON)                 # default OFF
option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Build Shared Library" ON)                # default ON
option(OPTIMIZE_PROJECT "Tidy up and optimize source code" OFF)    # default OFF
option(INITIALIZE_K4A_SDK "Initialize the kinect SDK project" OFF) # default ON
```
n.b., this project uses the Kinect for proof concept. The Kinect can be replace by any other sensor which facilitates 3D point clouds.

###### CAVEAT

When building the project for the first time, make sure `INITIALIZE_K4A_SDK` option is ON provide a bit of support for initializing the SDK.
Afterwards, be sure to turn the option off.
